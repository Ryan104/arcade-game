# Project 1 - Proposal

## Top-down arcade-style shoot'em up game
----------

### Inspiration
This game will take inspiration from [vertically scrolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertically_scrolling_video_game) arcade shooters such as [Galaga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaga), [Space Invaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders), [Yars Revenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yars%27_Revenge), and [1943](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1943:_The_Battle_of_Midway).

### Tools
The game will use the [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) javascript library to manipulate HTML5's `<canvas>`. Vanilla JS DOM manipulation will be used to handle the page outside of the canvas.
